# irisPredictApp

In this repo, a flask-based web application was created using the iris dataset. I recommend compiling the application on VS Code.

You can install the requirements with the following pip.
```
pip install requirements.txt
```

What you need to do to run the web application on localhost is to type "py app.py" or "phyton app.py" into the terminal you will open on VS Code.
